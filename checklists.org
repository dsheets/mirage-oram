* Checklists for the remainder of the project

** TODO Project Evaluation [2/15]

  - [X] Look at using a code coverage tool

  - [X] Gather more test data (more Gutenbergs and random data)

  - [ ] Extend unit tests to work on more data and have more coverage

  - [-] Define QuickCheck properties for each module [6/12]

    - [X] ORAM

    - [X] Stash

    - [X] PosMap

    - [X] Node

    - [ ] BTrees

    - [ ] FS

    - [ ] InodeIndex

    - [X] Bitarray

    - [ ] FreeMap

    - [X] Inode

    - [ ] InvertedIndex

    - [ ] SearchClient

  - [ ] Identify any parameters that could use optimisation and perform
        experiments to test these

  - [ ] Begin performance testing by examining options (Core_bench vs. own
        profiling)

  - [ ] Try and identify hot spots that could be optimised (Valgrind/Gprof)

  - [ ] Perform experiments that compare overhead due to ORAM vs. normal
        block device

  - [ ] Compare bandwidth overhead of recursive vs. non-recursive

  - [ ] Expand performance testing as necessary

  - [ ] Perform security analysis first by checking randomness of access pattern

  - [ ] Test uniformly writing/reading to a single address having randomness

  - [ ] Do regression tests between the same and different access patterns

  - [ ] Figure out how to break non-ORAM scheme to show worth of ORAM

  - [ ] Figure what we actually mean by randomness in the context of ORAM

** DONE Write Progress Report [4/4]
   CLOSED: [2016-01-29 Fri 17:32]

  - [X] Start LaTeX document for progress report

  - [X] Read Project Briefing Document to find our content needs

  - [X] Write necessary content

  - [X] Submit progress report (29/01/16)

** TODO Project Presentation [2/3]

  - [X] Read Project Briefing Document section about presentation

  - [X] Prepare slides for presentation

  - [ ] Practice the presentation in head before this Wednesday (for Improbable)
