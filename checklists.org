* Checklists for the remainder of the project

** TODO Project Evaluation [2/13]

  - [X] Look at using a code coverage tool

  - [X] Gather more test data (more Gutenbergs and random data)

  - [ ] Extend unit tests to work on more data and have more coverage

  - [ ] Use QuickCheck to push the functional tests even further

  - [ ] Identify any parameters that could use optimisation and perform
        experiments to test these

  - [ ] Begin performance testing by examining options (Core_bench vs. own
        profiling)

  - [ ] Try and identify hot spots that could be optimised

  - [ ] Perform experiments that compare overhead due to ORAM vs. normal
        block device

  - [ ] Compare bandwidth overhead of recursive vs. non-recursive

  - [ ] Expand performance testing as necessary

  - [ ] Perform security analysis first by checking randomness of access pattern

  - [ ] Do regression tests between the same and different access patterns

  - [ ] Figure out how to break non-ORAM scheme to show worth of ORAM

** TODO Write Progress Report [0/4]

  - [ ] Start LaTeX document for progress report

  - [ ] Read Project Briefing Document to find our content needs

  - [ ] Write necessary content

  - [ ] Submit progress report (29/01/16)

** TODO Project Presentation [0/3]

  - [ ] Read Project Briefing Document section about presentation

  - [ ] Prepare slides for presentation

  - [ ] Practice the presentation in head before this Wednesday (for Improbable)
