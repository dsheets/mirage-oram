\section*{Declaration}

I, Rupert Horlick of Homerton College, being a candidate for Part II of the Computer
Science Tripos, hereby declare
that this dissertation and the work described in it are my own work,
unaided except as may be specified below, and that the dissertation
does not contain material that has already been used to any substantial
extent for a comparable purpose.

% now for the chapters

\pagestyle{headings}

\chapter{Introduction}

% Give an overview of the problem - similar to the beginning of the project proposal

% Talk about increasing use of cloud computing

% Talk about loss of ability to search efficiently over documents

% Define threat model clearly

% Talk about solutions based on symmetric encryption

% Explain why these fail and what the consequences are

% Discuss ORAM as a solution to this problem

% Describe other work in the area of ORAM etc.

\section{Motivation}

\section{Challenges}

\section{Related Work}

\chapter{Preparation}

% Describe all work undertaken before the coding - show professional approach to project

% Talk about refining and clarifying model

% Talk about reviewing research papers to find best way of bringing things together

% Talk about choosing OCaml 	for its static typing and powerful module system

% Talk about how this led to designing the system in a modular way (include figure for system)

% Talk about MirageOS and building on top of it

\section{Introduction to ORAM}

% Talk about Path ORAM

\section{Introduction to Inverted Indexes}

% Talk about searching using an inverted index

\section{Requirements Analysis}

% Do requirements analysis in order to show that I thought about all of these things

\section{Choice of Tools}

% Do a table of tools used including OPAM, OASIS, git, Make, Atom, etc.

\section{Software Engineering Techniques}

% Talk about writing interface files before writing code in order to fit code to requirements and designing before implementing

% Talk about the ability to do Test Driven Development and the power of unit tests

\chapter{Implementation}

% Describe what was actually implemented

\chapter{Evaluation}

% ### Functionality ###

% Show that the unit tests show that individual components do what they are specified to do

% Path ORAM reads in and out correctly

% Encryption does make things encrypted

% Search is sound and complete...

% Etc.

% ### Performance ###

% Evaluate the performance of the code and do it with different configurations, varying functors used, size of input, potentially simulated network latency etc.

% ### Security ###

% Use statistical methods to show that access pattern is easily visible to Bob before applying ORAM to the system and the show statistical evidence the access pattern is hidden after applying ORAM
