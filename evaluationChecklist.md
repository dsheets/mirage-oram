[ ] Look at using a code coverage tool

[ ] Gather more test data (more Gutenbergs and random data)

[ ] Extend unit tests to work on more data and have more coverage

[ ] Use QuickCheck to push the functional tests even further

[ ] Identify any parameters that could use optimisation and perform
      experiments to test these

[ ] Begin performance testing by examining options (Core_bench vs. own
      profiling)

[ ] Try and identify hot spots that could be optimised

[ ] Perform experiments that compare overhead due to ORAM vs. normal
      block device

[ ] Compare bandwidth overhead of recursive vs. non-recursive

[ ] Expand performance testing as necessary

[ ] Perform security analysis first by checking randomness of access pattern

[ ] Do regression tests between the same and different access patterns

[ ] Figure out how to break non-ORAM scheme to show worth of ORAM
